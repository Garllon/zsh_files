# zsh_files

### Background

I am using [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)

### Environment varialbes

Create `env_varialbes` file. If you have any ENVIRONMENT variables you like to
load, but not push them to a repo.

Create a file named: `env_variables` in this repo.

Example how the file looks like:
```shell
export RAILS_ENV=development
export RACK_ENV=development
...
```

### Setup

Run the following in your console:
```shell
./setup.sh
```
